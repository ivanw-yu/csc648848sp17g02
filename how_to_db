Log into your MySQL account and execute the following statements.  These
will create the tables and populate the with a few entries:
    source ~/public_html/db_schema.sql
    source ~/public_html/db_inserts.sql

Next, open config/app.php and under the 'Datasources' entry, change the
'username', 'password', and 'database' fields to the username and password
that you use to log into MySQL, and the name of your database, which should
be 'student_<username>' where <username> is your MySQL account username.
For example:
    'Datasources' => [
        'default' => [
            'className' => 'Cake\Database\Connection',
            'driver' => 'Cake\Database\Driver\Mysql',
            'persistent' => false,
            'host' => 'localhost',
            'username' => 'drodri11'
            'password' => 'lol'
            'database' => 'student_drodri11',
            ...

Now change permissions of the logs and tmp folders.  The permissions that
are set during installation of CakePHP are not kept when cloning the
repository, so they need to be reset, otherwise there will be errors when
trying to use the model classes.  Change permissions by executing these
in the terminal in the root directory of public_html:
    chmod 777 logs/ -R
    chmod 777 tmp/ -R

One last thing that I think will be useful for you is enabling debug mode,
which displays proper error messages instead of a single line saying 'error'.
Do this in config/app.php by changing 'debug' => false to 'debug' => true.

All done!  Visit sfsuse.com/~my_username/db_test/categories to make sure
that everything is okay.  The page should load without errors.  From here
on out, data is accessed through the controller classes.  The following
section shows the hierarchy of the app--the basic process of how the data 
goes from model to controller to view.


1) Create the tables using a DBMS according to CakePHP naming conventions.
2) Change the config/app.php database permissions sections.
3) Execute bin/cake bake all table_name.
4) Create the findMethodName method in the model, using $this->find() to build
   a query.
5) Create the method in the controller, using the model's find('methodName')
   method.
6) Create a .ctp file to display something when the route is visited.
7) Edit confif/routes.php to create a new route associated with a table_name
   controller method.


Example:
Assume that 'categories' is a table in the database and that it follows
CakePHP naming conventions.

In the root directory of public_html:
./bin/cake bake all categories

In src/Model/Table/CategoriesTable.php, add the 'findCategories' method:
// The model gets the data directly from the database and returns it.
public function findCategories($query, $options) {
    $q = $this->find()->select(['category_name']);
    return $q;
}

In src/Controller/CategoriesController.php, add the 'display' method:
// The controller asks the model to query categories.  The data is then
// passed to the corresponding display.ctp file via set(...).
public function display() {
    $b = $this->Categories->find('categories');
    $this->set(['id' => $b]);
}

In src/Template/Categories/display.ctp:
<!-- The view displays data passed by the controller. -->

<?php
/**
  * @var \App\View\AppView $this
  */
?>
<ul>
<?php foreach ($id as $row): ?>
   <li> <?= $row->category_name ?> </li>
<?php endforeach; ?>
</ul>

In config/routes.php:
// Make db_test/categories visitable.
Router::scope('/db_test', function(RouteBuilder $routes) {
    $routes->connect('/categories',
                     ['controller' => 'Categories',
                      'action' => 'display']);
});
